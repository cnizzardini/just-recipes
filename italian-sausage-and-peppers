# Italian Sausage and Peppers

Just the fucking receipe. If you want a grain option cook some white rice, angel hair pasta, or use some italian rolls. I 
prefer angel hair pasta and sometimes rice, rarely rolls. Just mix in the end product with your pasta or rice to add 
flavor to your grains. If using rolls, you know what to do.

## Ingredients

- A pack of sausages
- 2 tablespoons of olive oil or whatever, I don't measure
- Some Bell Peppers, slice them into long strips
- Some garlic, again I don't measure. Buy the pre-minced stuff if you're a lazy bachelor like me
- Yellow onion, I usually use half of it and chop it fine
- Some canned crushed tomatoes or you can just throw in some cheap spaghetti sauce, around a cup or so
- Salt, pepper, and any other seasonings that you like. Sprinkle them in.

## Optional

- Some oregano, you probably won't notice it, but throw in a pinch if you got it.
- A splash of red wine.

## Items

- Large pan with lid
