# Basic Ass Pork Chops in the Oven

This is a really basic recipe. I like to buy pork chops everytime I shop and throw them in the freezer. It's a really 
easy meal to cook. Honestly there are better recipes out there, but this is for bachelors on the go.

## Ingrediants 

- Pork chops
- Teriyaki Sauce or similar
- Butter
- Olive Oil
- Seasoning

## Pair with

Any vegetable and boxed rice. But really anything pairs with this.

## Cooking

### Step 1

Put some butter down on one of those glass pyrex cooking dishes. One slice for each chop, then drizzle each slice with 
some olive oil. Place the pork chops in a cooking dish ontop of butter.

Now stab the chops with a fork. Then pour teriyaki over the chops. This lets the sauce get in there. Now season your 
chops with seasoning of choice. I use season salt, garlic salt, pepper, and regular salt. You can let them sit for 
a little bit, half hour tops.

Preheat oven to 400.

Once heated place chops in and set timer to about 20 minutes. 

If your chops are the really thick ones, add a little extra time. If they are the thin ones (I don't recommend these) then 
go a little less. I generally go for a chop that looks about an inch or a little over an inch in thickness. Anything less 
doesn't retain juices well, anything more takes too long to cook IMO.

All that oil and butter we added should make cleaning your dish easy. Drizzle the drippings onto your chops and 
fill the cooking dish with water so its easy to clean after you're done.

For the veggies an easy one is yellow and green squash. Chop them up, put them into a pan with olive oil and season them. 
Toss them around and flip them until they look ready. Medium-high heat is fine.
