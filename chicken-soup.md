# Chicken Noodle Soup

## Step 1: Brine

- Chicken (boneless breast and chicken legs with the bone in obviously)
- 2 litres / 2 quarts water , cold tap water
- 1/3 cup kosher or cooking salt, NOT table salt (Note 1)
- 2 lemons , quartered
- 10 sprigs parsley , fresh
- 7 sprigs thyme
- 2 sprigs rosemary
- 5 bay leaves, fresh (or 3 dried)
- 1‚ÅÑ4 cup honey
- 6 garlic cloves, smashed (Note 3)
- 1 tbsp black peppercorns
- 2 tbsp olive oil

1. Heat the olive oil on medium
2. Saute the garlic for 60 seconds
3. Pour about 1/3 of the water into a large pot (large enough for the brine and submerged chicken) with remaining Brine ingredients. Bring to boil boil 1 minute, stir to dissolve salt.
4. Remove from heat, pour in remaining water. Cool completely before using (this can take an hour or more). If its cold outside put it outside with lid on to reduce cooling time.
5. Put the chicken in and refrigerate for 12 - 24 hours.
