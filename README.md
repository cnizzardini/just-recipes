# Just Some Fucking Recipes

Just recipes for dishes. No long intro parapgraphs about the first time you tasted linguine while meandering the coast of the Adriatic Sea. No life story about how some suave Spaniard swept you off your feet while sipping sangria on Las Ramblas. And definitely without the 13 megatons of JavaScript trackers. Just recipes I copied from other places that load fast in my browser. Why? Because none of that shit matters when I'm hungry and want to cook.
